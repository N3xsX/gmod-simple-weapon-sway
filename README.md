# Simple Weapon Sway
Like the title says its simple weapon sway. Nothing fancy, just some basic math to set cmd:SetViewAngles

For now weapons with this prefixes:
```
mg_ ; cw_ ; tfa_ ; weapon_ ; arc9_
```
will work with the sway. 

Im planning on making whitelist to add your own prefixes or just straight up adding a specific weapon
